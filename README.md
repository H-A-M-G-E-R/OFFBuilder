# OFFBuilder
Generates OFF files for convex polytopes from their coordinates.
Truly fixed the monotopal element bug using Gaussian elimination and shrank the size of OFFBuilder.exe.

How to use (Windows):
1. Compile it (Release)
2. Download qhull from http://www.qhull.org/download/ and put it in the same path as OFFBuilder.exe.
